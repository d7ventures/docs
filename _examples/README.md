# Mintlify Example Files

This directory contains example files from Mintlify that were removed from the main documentation but kept for reference.

## Contents

- **essentials/**: Example documentation about Markdown syntax, code formatting, images, etc.
- **endpoint/**: Example API endpoint documentation files

## Purpose

These files are kept as examples to understand Mintlify's documentation patterns and components, but are not displayed in the actual documentation site.

## Usage

You can reference these files when creating new documentation to understand:

- Mintlify component usage
- Markdown formatting patterns
- Documentation structure examples

## Note

Files in this directory (prefixed with `_`) are automatically ignored by Mintlify and won't appear in the documentation site.
