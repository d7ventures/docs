## Implementation Notes

### Permanent Deletion

- **This action is irreversible** - deleted connections cannot be recovered
- All associated data is permanently removed from the database
- OAuth credentials are revoked and cleaned up

### Cascading Effects

- All tool access records are removed
- OAuth client credentials are deleted
- Connection history is purged
- Any active sessions using this connection are invalidated

### Access Control

- Users can only delete their own connections
- Connection ownership is verified before deletion
- Admin users may have broader deletion permissions

### Verification

- After deletion, attempts to access the connection will return 404
- The connection ID becomes invalid and cannot be reused
- All related resources are cleaned up
