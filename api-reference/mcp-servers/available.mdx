## Implementation Notes

### Integration Discovery

- Integrations are loaded from the main database
- Only active and supported integrations are returned
- Tool counts are calculated dynamically

### Tool Counting

- Includes both local MCP server tools and external API endpoints
- Only publicly available tools are counted
- Tool counts may vary based on integration configuration

### Caching

- Results are cached for improved performance
- Cache is invalidated when new integrations are added
- Fresh tool counts are calculated periodically
