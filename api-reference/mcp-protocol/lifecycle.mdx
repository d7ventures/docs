<Info>**Protocol Revision**: 2025-06-18</Info>

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a rigorous lifecycle for client-server connections that ensures proper capability negotiation and state management.

1. **Initialization**: Capability negotiation and protocol version agreement
2. **Operation**: Normal protocol communication
3. **Shutdown**: Graceful termination of the connection

## Lifecycle Phases

### Initialization

The initialization phase **MUST** be the first interaction between client and server. During this phase, the client and server:

- Establish protocol version compatibility
- Exchange and negotiate capabilities
- Share implementation details

The client **MUST** initiate this phase by sending an `initialize` request containing:

- Protocol version supported
- Client capabilities
- Client implementation information

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "sampling": {},
      "elicitation": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "title": "Example Client Display Name",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The server **MUST** respond with its own capabilities and information:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "resources": {
        "subscribe": true,
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "tools": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "completions": {}
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "KambriumMCPServer",
      "title": "Kambrium MCP Server",
      "version": "2.1.0"
    },
    "instructions": "Optional instructions for the client"
  }
}
```

After successful initialization, the client **MUST** send an `initialized` notification to indicate it is ready to begin normal operations:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/initialized"
}
```

- The client **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than pings before the server has responded to the `initialize` request.
- The server **SHOULD NOT** send requests other than pings and logging before receiving the `initialized` notification.

#### Version Negotiation

In the `initialize` request, the client **MUST** send a protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the client.

If the server supports the requested protocol version, it **MUST** respond with the same version. Otherwise, the server **MUST** respond with another protocol version it supports. This **SHOULD** be the _latest_ version supported by the server.

If the client does not support the version in the server's response, it **SHOULD** disconnect.

<Note>
  **Kambrium HTTP Implementation**: The client **MUST** include the `MCP-Protocol-Version: <protocol-version>` HTTP header on all subsequent requests to the MCP server.
</Note>

#### Capability Negotiation

Client and server capabilities establish which optional protocol features will be available during the session.

Key capabilities include:

| Category | Capability     | Description                                              |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client   | `roots`        | Ability to provide filesystem roots                      |
| Client   | `sampling`     | Support for LLM sampling requests                        |
| Client   | `elicitation`  | Support for server elicitation requests                  |
| Client   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features |
| Server   | `prompts`      | Offers prompt templates                                  |
| Server   | `resources`    | Provides readable resources                              |
| Server   | `tools`        | Exposes callable tools                                   |
| Server   | `logging`      | Emits structured log messages                            |
| Server   | `completions`  | Supports argument autocompletion                         |
| Server   | `experimental` | Describes support for non-standard experimental features |

Capability objects can describe sub-capabilities like:

- `listChanged`: Support for list change notifications (for prompts, resources, and tools)
- `subscribe`: Support for subscribing to individual items' changes (resources only)

**Kambrium Implementation:** Based on our test suite (Category 01 - MCP Core Protocol), we implement all standard capabilities with proper negotiation.

### Operation

During the operation phase, the client and server exchange messages according to the negotiated capabilities.

Both parties **MUST**:

- Respect the negotiated protocol version
- Only use capabilities that were successfully negotiated

**Kambrium Implementation:** Our test suite validates operation phase behavior across all categories.

### Shutdown

During the shutdown phase, one side (usually the client) cleanly terminates the protocol connection. No specific shutdown messages are definedâ€”instead, the underlying transport mechanism should be used to signal connection termination:

#### HTTP

For HTTP transports, shutdown is indicated by closing the associated HTTP connection(s).

**Kambrium Implementation:** Our HTTP transport supports graceful shutdown via session termination and connection closure.

## Timeouts

Implementations **SHOULD** establish timeouts for all sent requests, to prevent hung connections and resource exhaustion. When the request has not received a success or error response within the timeout period, the sender **SHOULD** issue a cancellation notification for that request and stop waiting for a response.

**Kambrium Implementation:** Based on our test suite (Category 06 - MCP Utilities), we implement proper timeout handling with cancellation support.

SDKs and other middleware **SHOULD** allow these timeouts to be configured on a per-request basis.

Implementations **MAY** choose to reset the timeout clock when receiving a progress notification corresponding to the request, as this implies that work is actually happening. However, implementations **SHOULD** always enforce a maximum timeout, regardless of progress notifications, to limit the impact of a misbehaving client or server.

## Error Handling

Implementations **SHOULD** be prepared to handle these error cases:

- Protocol version mismatch
- Failure to negotiate required capabilities
- Request timeouts

Example initialization error:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32602,
    "message": "Unsupported protocol version",
    "data": {
      "supported": ["2025-06-18"],
      "requested": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Kambrium Implementation:** Our error handling (verified in test categories) follows JSON-RPC standards with detailed error responses.

## Kambrium Session Management

For HTTP-based clients, Kambrium implements additional session management features:

### Session Headers

```http
POST /pipedrive/mcp HTTP/1.1
Host: api.kambrium.com
Authorization: Bearer oauth_token_here
MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-06-18
Mcp-Session-Id: session_abc123_xyz789
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Session Creation**: Automatic during initialization with `Mcp-Session-Id` header
2. **Session Validation**: Required on all subsequent requests
3. **Session Termination**: Explicit via DELETE request or timeout

Based on our multi-tenant test suite (Category 08), sessions provide complete tenant isolation and security.
