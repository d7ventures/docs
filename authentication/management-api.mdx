---

The Management API handles administrative operations for MCP server connections using two authentication methods.

## OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials

Standard OAuth flow for production applications:

```bash
curl -X POST https://us-east-1clpqjbygz.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u "client_id:client_secret" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=mgmt.read+mgmt.write"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "mgmt.read mgmt.write"
}
```

**Using the token:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs..." \
  https://api.kambrium.com/api/v1/mcp-servers
```

## Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

Long-lived tokens generated directly in the platform web interface for automated access and scripting scenarios.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Long-lived (no expiration by default)
- Generated via web UI rather than OAuth flow
- Uses same JWT structure as OAuth tokens for compatibility
- Suitable for CI/CD, automation, and development workflows

**Token Claims Structure:**

PAT tokens follow standard JWT structure with these key claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_CLpqjbYgz",
  "aud": "kambrium-mcp",
  "sub": "account_id",
  "client_id": "pat_<random_string>",
  "scopes": ["mgmt.read", "mgmt.write"],
  "token_use": "access",
  "token_type": "pat",
  "mcp_server_id": 1,
  "iat": 1704067200,
  "jti": "pat_<token_identifier>"
}
```

**Using PAT tokens:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <PAT_TOKEN>" \
  https://api.kambrium.com/api/v1/mcp-servers
```

## Available Scopes

- **mgmt.read** - Read MCP server configurations and status
- **mgmt.write** - Create, update, and delete MCP server connections
- **mgmt.admin** - Administrative operations and system management

## Token Security Best Practices

### OAuth Token Lifecycle

- Tokens expire in 1 hour by default
- Refresh tokens automatically before expiration
- Store tokens securely in memory or secure storage

### PAT Security

- Rotate PATs regularly (recommended every 90 days)
- Store PATs in secure credential management systems
- Limit scope to minimum required permissions
- Monitor PAT usage for anomalies

### General Security

- Always use HTTPS for token requests
- Never log or expose tokens in application code
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
