description: "OAuth 2.1 and PAT authentication for MCP protocol operations"
---

MCP servers require authentication for protocol operations, tool execution, resource access, and prompt retrieval using the same two methods as the Management API.

## OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials

Standard OAuth flow for production MCP clients:

```bash
curl -X POST https://us-east-1clpqjbygz.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u "client_id:client_secret" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=mgmt.read+mgmt.write"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "mgmt.read mgmt.write"
}
```

## Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

Long-lived tokens for MCP server access, suitable for automation and development workflows.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Long-lived (no expiration by default)
- Generated via web UI for specific MCP server instances
- Uses same JWT structure as OAuth tokens for compatibility
- Suitable for CI/CD, automation, and development scenarios

**Token Claims Structure:**

PAT tokens follow standard JWT structure with these key claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_CLpqjbYgz",
  "aud": "kambrium-mcp",
  "sub": "account_id",
  "client_id": "pat_<random_string>",
  "scopes": ["mgmt.read", "mgmt.write"],
  "token_use": "access",
  "token_type": "pat",
  "mcp_server_id": 1,
  "iat": 1704067200,
  "jti": "pat_<token_identifier>"
}
```

## Available Scopes

Based on the Management API, the following scopes are used for MCP server access:

- **mgmt.read** - Read MCP server configurations, status, tools, resources, and prompts
- **mgmt.write** - Create, update, and delete MCP server connections
- **mgmt.admin** - Administrative operations and system management

## MCP Protocol Authentication

### Session Initialization

All MCP protocol operations require proper authentication headers:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Mcp-Session-Id: <session_id>" \
  https://mcp.kambrium.com/user_endpoint
```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Obtain Token**: Use OAuth 2.1 Client Credentials or PAT
2. **Initialize Session**: Send `initialize` request with capabilities
3. **Session Established**: Receive session ID in `Mcp-Session-Id` header
4. **Send Notification**: Send `notifications/initialized`
5. **Authenticated Requests**: Include both Bearer token and session ID in subsequent requests

### Session Headers

**Required headers for all MCP requests:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Content-Type: application/json
Mcp-Session-Id: <session_id>
```

### Token Validation

MCP servers validate tokens on every request:

- **OAuth tokens**: Verified against OAuth provider and checked for expiration
- **PAT tokens**: Validated against stored hash and scope permissions
- **Session correlation**: Session ID must match authenticated user context

## Server-Specific Access

**Tokens with mcp_server_id:** Access specific MCP server instance  
**Tokens without mcp_server_id:** Access all authorized MCP servers

## Security Considerations

### Token Lifecycle

- OAuth tokens: 1-hour expiration, automatic refresh required
- PAT tokens: Long-lived, manual rotation recommended
- Session tokens: Temporary, tied to connection lifetime

### Best Practices

- Store tokens securely in application memory or credential vault
- Implement token refresh logic for OAuth flows
- Monitor authentication failures and rate limits
- Use minimum required scopes for principle of least privilege
